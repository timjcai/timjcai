### Hi there 👋

🔭 What I'm building
  > 1. Calendah - Full-stack Calendar app that adds Hotkey into my Calendar Workflow
  > 2. EatList - Full-stack Web App to save and review restaurants that I want to try within local cities (a swipe file for restaurant suggestions)
  > 3. Calorie Tracking / Recipe App (building a database to suggest recipes based on my leftover calories and macronutrient goals)
